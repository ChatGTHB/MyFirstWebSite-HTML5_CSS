            <p class="text">
                The Maiden's Tower (Turkish: Kız Kulesi), also known as Leander's Tower (Tower of Leandros) since the
                medieval Byzantine period, is a tower on a small islet at the southern entrance of the Bosphorus strait,
                200 m (220 yd) from the coast of Üsküdar in Istanbul, Turkey.

                The tower appeared on the reverse of the Turkish 10 lira banknote from 1966 to 1981.

            <h3 class="headling">History</h3>
            <p class="text">
                After the naval victory at Cyzicus, in 408 BC the Athenian general Alcibiades probably built a custom
                station for ships coming from the Black Sea on a small rock in front of Chrysopolis (today's Üsküdar).

            <br>
            <h3 class="headling">Origin of the name</h3>
            <p class="text">
                There are several stories about the tower's name. According to one story, an oracle prophesied that the
                emperor's much beloved daughter would be killed by a venomous snake on her 18th birthday. In an effort
                to protect her, the emperor had the tower built in the Bosphorus and had her locked there to keep her
                away from any snakes. Her only regular visitor was her father. On her 18th birthday, the emperor brought
                her a basket of exotic fruits as a gift, delighted that he had been able to thwart the prophecy.
                However, an asp that had been hiding among the fruit bit the princess who died in her father's arms,
                just as the oracle had predicted, hence the name Maiden's Tower.
